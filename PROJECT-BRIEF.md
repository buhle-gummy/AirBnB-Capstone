Brief for Admin Dashboard
Project Overview
The objective is to create an Admin Dashboard for an Airbnb clone application. The dashboard should
allow administrators to create, view, update, and delete property listings. Additionally, the admin
dashboard should have a user authentication system to manage login, logout, and user sessions.
Expected Skills and Technologies
- Frontend: React.js, CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (CRUD operations are excluded from this rubric but included
for backend rubric)
- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- File Handling: Image upload and display (**Optional**)
Instructions
Admin Dashboard Instructions
1. Top Header:
- Implement a top header that includes the Airbnb logo and navigation links.
- When a user is logged in, display a greeting with their username and provide a dropdown menu with
options to view reservations and log out.
- When a user is logged out, display a "Become a host" link.
2. Login Page:
- Create a login page with a form that includes fields for email and password.
- Implement input validation and display appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
- On successful login, redirect the user to the admin dashboard.
3. Create Listing Page:
- Develop a form for creating new property listings with all necessary fields (title, location, description,
bedrooms, bathrooms, guests, type, price, amenities, images, weekly discount, cleaning fee, service fee,
occupancy taxes).
- Ensure the form has robust input validation and displays clear error messages.
- Include functionality for image uploads.
4. View Listings Page:
- Display a list of all property listings with key details (title, location, price, main image).
- Provide options to update or delete each listing.
5. Update Listing Page:
- Similar to the create listing page, but pre-fill the form with the existing data of the listing being updated.
- Ensure that updates are saved and reflected correctly.
6. User Authentication:
- Implement user authentication using JWT.
- Ensure that user sessions are maintained and only logged-in users can access the admin dashboard.

- Add functionality to the profile icon in the header to display a dropdown menu with options to view
reservations and log out.
Recommended user Data Structure
{
username: 'John Doe',
password: 'password123',
role: 'user',
},
{
username: 'Jane Doe',
password: 'password321',
role: 'host',
},

7. Navigation and Routing:
- Ensure smooth navigation between different pages.
- Update the URL to reflect the current view.
8. Styling:
- Apply consistent styling across the application.
9. Error Handling and Feedback:
- Implement error handling throughout the application.
- Provide clear feedback to users in case of errors.
10. Code Quality and Documentation:
- Write clean, well-organized, and commented code.
- Ensure that functions are modular and reusable.

Brief for Airbnb Frontend Clone
The goal of this project is to create a functional and visually appealing frontend for an Airbnb clone using
React. The project will cover three main views: Home Page, Location Page, and Location Details Page.
Each view will have specific components and functionalities to meet the project requirements. The Home
Page will be static with a dynamic filter and login functionality. The Location Page will display a list of
locations based on user selection, and the Location Details Page will provide detailed information about a
selected location, including a cost calculator and reservation functionality.
